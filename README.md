## MY JOURNEY <a name="journey"></a>
This weather app was created from a previous project, it calls a weather api and a jokes api my goals for this project is to add the following:

- [ ] Create 2 tables, users and weather categories
![schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/907dec23-653c-4aba-aa6a-f267eb56d29d);
I ended up pivioting from this, will return to this in a different intteration.

Data schema instead became a voting table for the jokes
